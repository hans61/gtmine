# Minesweeper for the GIGATRON

The game Minesweeper should be familiar to most.
The Gigatron is a 1980's style computer consisting of just a handful of 7400 series TTL chips.
Everything about the Gigatron can be found here:

There are two compilers for the Gigatron. A BASIC and a C compiler. With the gtBASIC I had already made a game. It can be found here:

To play a bit with the glcc compiler I decided to use Minesweeper. You can find the glcc here:
